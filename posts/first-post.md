title: 'My Programming Journey (So Far)'

In my freshman year of high school (2015), I was heavily caught up in the programming craze. As someone born and raised in Silicon Valley, I was surrounded by numerous classmates aspiring to work in the tech industry. Largely successful entrepreneurs we used to not hate such as Mark Zuckerberg preached programming as the New Testament and encouraged everyone to start coding as soon as possible. I remember feeling inspired to plunge into the world of software engineering after watching this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc).

My first project was very ambitious: create an e-commerce website for my clothing business using a custom payment processor. I decided to learn HTML + CSS + JavaScript through the help of [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)’s online courses. Those who have any amount of experience in programming know that building an entire e-commerce website from scratch is the worst possible decision to make as a beginner. My naive self did not realize this at the time, and I felt discouraged to continue my shortly-lived coding journey after encountering many roadblocks. I struggled with errors for hours and felt frustrated for not being able to get to the next step. Within a few weeks, I quit and decided that I was not capable enough to learn anything related to programming.

Fast forward to the present, I’m studying Business Management at Santa Clara University. I was fortunate enough to be accepted in the school’s 4+1 program, which allowed me to start taking Master’s courses during my senior year. I wanted to pursue an MS in Business Analytics to develop my technical skills. In Fall 2022, I was enrolled in an MS course called Data Analytics — Python. Being horrified at the high chance that I would fail the class due to my lack of competence in programming, I decided to be proactive by self-learning Python 3 through [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) before the class started.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with Codecademy, its interface has an in-browser IDE (integrated development environment), eliminating the need to download an external IDE. I fully expected myself to start the course for around a week, then quit halfway through. Surprisingly, I noticed how intuitive it felt to learn Python over something like HTML + CSS. Following the instructions and receiving immediate results from the built-in IDE made a once impossible task (learning how to program) feel possible. Within 1–2 months, I successfully completed Codecademy’s Python 3 course.

As I became more and more comfortable with Python, my initial dread of taking this class was being slowly reduced. Learning programming online has its benefits, but it also comes with certain limitations such as lack of collaboration, tailored feedback, and more. With a small class size of ~20 students, it was a lot easier to make new friends and ask questions. The class primarily focused on concepts correlating to different Python packages (pandas, seaborn, numpy, sklearn) such as univariate time series, groupby, merge, classification, etc., which are essential to cleaning and analyzing hundreds of thousands of rows of data.

For some strange reason, I was having fun doing homework assignments for this Data Analytics class. I couldn’t understand why at the time, but I believe it was because it felt interesting, intuitive, and practical for real-world usage. I want to shout out Professor [Yu-Wei Lin](https://www.scu.edu/business/isa/faculty/lin/) for being a really thoughtful and patient teacher. He always took the time to answer my questions and offered valuable feedback. Without him, I don’t think I would enjoy data analytics nearly as much. 

Here’s a funny story: for our final group project presentation, I rehearsed the slides with my group several times and made everyone wear business-casual attire. Once we got into class, we noticed that Professor Lin brought the entire class pizzas and soda. While every group was presenting, the other groups were listening while munching down on pizza. It was truly the first time where I felt happy doing a class presentation.

In my final Spring quarter as an undergrad, I no longer have any classes to take. For the last 4 weeks, I have been working on a personal website to display my interests and projects. The recent rise of Next.js and Tailwind CSS (both of which I used) has made making websites more accessible and enjoyable. I learned the absolute basics by following along Next.js’s [well-written tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) and went from there. Afterwards, I wanted to implement more elements to my site but didn’t know where to start. I reached out to my webdev enthusiast friend [Daniel](https://twitter.com/d2ac__) for help. We went on call for hours every week to add new features and resolve bugs/errors. Thank you Daniel for helping me out without expecting anything in return, you’re the goat! Make sure to check out his upcoming project [Flow](https://www.flowapp.so/).

Now that I have finished my website, I plan to add/create a couple of projects related to data analytics, which will be featured on my GitHub, over the next couple of weeks. Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a great rest of your day! ❤️
