title: 'My Programming Journey (So Far)'

In my freshman year of high school (2015), I was heavily caught up in the programming craze. As someone born and raised in Silicon Valley, I was surrounded by numerous classmates aspiring to work in the tech industry. Largely successful entrepreneurs we used to not hate such as Mark Zuckerberg preached programming as the New Testament and encouraged everyone to start coding as soon as possible. I remember feeling inspired to plunge into the world of software engineering after watching this video below:

My first project was very ambitious: create an e-commerce website for my clothing business using a custom payment processor. I decided to learn HTML + CSS + JavaScript through the help of [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)â€™s online courses. Those who have any amount of experience in programming know that building an entire e-commerce website from scratch is the worst possible decision to make as a beginner. My naive self did not realize this at the time, and I felt discouraged to continue my shortly-lived coding journey after encountering many roadblocks. I struggled with errors for hours and felt frustrated for not being able to get to the next step. Within a few weeks, I quit and decided that I was not capable enough to learn anything related to programming.
