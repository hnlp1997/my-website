This is my very first project where I got to work with web development frameworks like Next.js + Tailwind CSS. As a "data analytics" person myself, doing web dev feels like a totally different ball field. On one hand, it was very rewarding and exciting to see your own code turn into something tangible (aka your application). On the other hand, I realized that web developers have a much tougher time of finding the answer/solution to errors since they are usually very specific to one's application, while errors found in data analytics projects are more broad and easier to debug on Stack Overflow or ChatGBT.

I started out with Next.js's [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app), which helped me build a good foundation for my website. Next.js's sample website looks like this: https://next-learn-starter.vercel.app/ (you can totally notice similarities between the two). However, I wanted to add more personality and functionality to my website, but didn't have enough experience with Next.js + Tailwind CSS to progress. I reached out to my friend [Daniel Fu](https://github.com/itsnotaka), a web dev enthusiast, for assistance. He helped me a ton on this website, and showed me how to integrate different API's, such as [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) (to display whenever I'm listening to music on Spotify on the top left-hand corner) and [Cloudinary's API](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference) (to capture the best photos from my phone's camera roll). We would spend hours every week on call adding new features and debugging. I learned so much from him and am honored to call him a friend. Be sure to check out his upcoming project [Flow](https://www.flowapp.so/), the next best productivity tool!

I'm extremely happy to finally finish my website and share it to my friends and family. I think (and hope) that it represents me in the best way possible. For now, I'll stick with the field of data analytics, but this project definitely almost convinced me to pursue web development instead :)
